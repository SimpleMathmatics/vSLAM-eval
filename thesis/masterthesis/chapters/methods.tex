\chapter{Introduntion to vSLAM Algorithms}

SLAM is one of the most emerging research topics in robotics \cite{slamintro}. It is applied in various applications, such as in augmented reality to estimate the camera pose,
autonomous navigation and computer vision-based online 3D modeling \cite{evolved} \cite{dso}.
The problem can be defined in a probabilistic way. The goal is to compute 

$$\mathbb{P}\left(m_{t+1},x_{t+1}|z_{1:t+1},u_{1:t}\right)$$

Where, as can be found in figure \ref{fig:slamover}, $m_{t+1}$ is the map (pointcloud of the surroundings) at timepoint $t+1$, $x_{t+1}$ the 
camera pose and position at timepoint $t+1$, $z_{1:t+1}$ all observations made to this timepoint and $u_{1:t}$ all historic control input. However, most
modern SLAM methods don't require the control input anymore.

With their work on the representation and estimation of spatial uncertainty \cite{hist1}
Smith et al created the first relevant work in the field on SLAM in 1986. However, due to lacking computational recources, the engagement in this topic stayed aminly
on a theoretical level. 


  \begin{quote}
   The result of this conversation was a recognition that
	consistent probabilistic mapping was a fundamental problem
	in robotics with major conceptual and computational issues
	that needed to be addressed. \cite{hist2}
  \end{quote}
  
This is because already then it was recognized, that camera pose and landmark positions had to be updated when moving further or optimizing the map and is a huge computational 
effort as the map grows. 

As time progressed, so did the computational resources and the algorithms became more advanced. Huge evolvements were achieved after 2010 \cite{evolved}, mainly because of the increased
use of augmented reality application, that may rely on real time vSLAM algorithms. The developed vSLAM methods can be devidet into two different classes: direct and feature based methods.

Direct algorithms use the entire image as input in order to compute the term in quotation \ref{eq:goal}. Therefore, the term is computed by optimizing the photometric error. 
This is the error, that results from comparing the intensities of each pixel after transformation (optimization) \cite{dso}. 

  \begin{quote}
	One of the main benefits of a direct formulation is that it
	does not require a point to be recognizable by itself, thereby
	allowing for a more finely grained geometry representation (pixelwise inverse depth). \cite{dso}
  \end{quote}

Feature based methods on the other hand, compute features for each frame, that serve as imput for further computation. These features usually are subsets of pixels, that have remarkable 
intensities and arrangement, such as corners (landmarks). These methods evaluate the upper term by computing the geometric error, since the feature positions are geomtric 
quantities. A main advantage of feature based methods is the rubostness over geometric distortions present in every-day-cameras \cite{dso}. 

Of all existing vSLAM algorithms, this work considers DSO, DSM and ORB SLAM for the evaluation of beeing a suited candide for flying a drone autonomously. This desicion is based on 
other research results in this area.

In the following section, an overview over how the algorithms work is given for each method. However, in order to understand this section, it is crutial to clarify basic definitions 
and vocabulary used in SLAM

	\section{Definitions}
		
		\subsubsection{Keyframe}
		
		Most vSLAM Algorithms make usage of so called keyframes, as these keyframe-based approaches have proven to be more accurate \cite{keyframe}.
		Keyframes are specific selected images of the input sequences or video streams. In most cases, the keyframes store all of the existing 
		map points and all of the computations and optimizations are made, based on the keyframes and data stored within them. 
	
		\subsubsection{Covisibility Graph}
		
		updating the edges resulting from the shared map
		points with other keyframes.
		
		\subsubsection{Group of Rigid Transformations in 3D}
		
		$\text{SE}(3)$ is the group of rigid transformations in 3D space \cite{se3}. Each Matrix $ T \in \mathbb{R}^{4x4}$ with 
		
		$$ T = \left[
		\begin{array}{rrr}
		R &  t \\  
		0  & 1 \\ 
		\end{array} \right]$$
		
		and $ R \in \mathbb{R}^{3x3}$ beiing a rotation matrix and $ t \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ a translational vector, is an element of $\text{SE}(3)$.
		
		\subsubsection{Pointcloud}
		
		When we speak of pointcloud, we simply mean a formation of points in the threedimensional space, though having
		an x y and z coordinate. Later in the evaluation of the algorithms, to save these pointclouds, the PLY format has 
		been chosen. 

	\section{ORB-SLAM}
	
	ORB SLAM is a feature based, state of the art slam method. The first version was published in 2015 \cite{orb}. 
	Here, an overview of the functionality of ORB SLAM is provided. The Algorithms runs on three threats simultanously.
	Each thread performes one of the following tasks: Tracking, Local Mapping and Loop Closing. An overview over the tasks can be found 
	in figure \ref{fig:orb_fig}. The explaination of these system components are described in the following subsections. 
	A more detailed explaination can be found in the paper of Raul Mur-Artal et al \cite{orb}.
	
	\fig{img/orb_slam_overview.png}{Overview of the system components extracted from \cite{orb}}{fig:orb_fig}{0.6}
	
	\subsection{Tracking}
	
	The tracking component determines the localization of the camera and decides, when a new keyframe is beeing inserted.
	As it is shown in figure \ref{fig:orb_fig}, the tracking is performed in four steps.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Feature Extracting 
	
	Features are extracted using Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF \cite{orb_feat}. This method starts by searching for 
	FAST (Features from Accelerated and Segments Test). Herefor, for each pixel x in the image, a circle of 16 pixels around that pixels
	is considered and checked if at least eight of these 16 pixels have major brightness differences. If so, the pixel x is considered as 
	a keypoint, since it is likely to be an edge or corner. This is repeated again and again after downsizing the image up to a scale of eight. 
	To extract features evenly distributed over the image, it is devided into a grid, trying to extract five features per cell. 
	Extracting features this way, makes the algorithm more stable to scale invariance. 
	Next the orientation of the extracted feature is calculated using a intensity centroid. 
	Finally the features are converted into a binary vectors (ORB descriptor) using a modified version, which is more robust to rotation, of BRIEF descriptors (Binary robust independent elementary feature).
	% wenn ich noch mehr brauch kann ich hier noch was adden. These ORB descriptors are then used for all feature matching tasks. 
	
	
	
	\item Initial Pose Estimation
	
	A constant velocity model is first run to predict to the camera pose. Then, the features of the last frame are searched. If no matches are found, 
	a wider area around the last position is searched. 
	
	\item Track Local Map 
	
	When the camera pose is estimated, map point correspondences are searched in 
	the local map, containing keyframes that contain the observed map points and
	the keyframes from the covisibility graph. The pose is then corrected with all
	matched mappoints. 
	
	% wenn ich noch mehr brauche, hier weitermachen.
	
	
	\item New Keyframe Decision 
	
	To insert the current frame as a keyframe, the following conditions have to be met:
	more than 20 frames have to be passed from the last relocalization or keyframe insertion (when not idle), 
    the current frame tracks at least 50 points or less than 90 percent of the points of the keyframe in the local 
    map with the most shard mappoints. 	
	
	
	\end{enumerate}
	

	
	\subsection{Local Mapping}
	
	Whenever a new Keyframe $K_i$ is inserted, the map is updated. 
	
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{KeyFrame Insertion}
	
	The keyframe is inserted in the covisibility graph. Then the spanning tree
	is updated using using the keyframe with the most common points with $K_i$.
	Finally the keyframe is represented as a bag of words using the DBoW2 implementation. 
	Therefor, the image is saved by the number of occurances of features found in a a predefined
	vocabulary of features. When the vocabulary is created with images general enough, 
	it can be used for most environments.

	\item{Recent Map Points Culling}
	
	A mappoint is removed from the map, when it is found in more than 
	25/% in the frames where it is predicted to be visible. Also, 
	it must be observed from more than two keyframes if more than one keyframe 
	has passed from map point creation. 
	
	\item{New Map Point Creation}
	
	A map point is created by calculating the triangulation of the connected
	keyframes in the covisibility graph. For each map point, the 3D coordinate 
	in the world coordinate system, its ORB descriptor, the viewing direction, 
	the maximim and minimum distance at which the point can be observed is stored. 
	
	\item{Local Bundle Adjustment}
	
	The keyframe poses $T_i \in \text{SE}(3)$ and Map Points $X_j \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ 
	are optimized by minizing the reprojection error to the matched keypoints $x_{i,j} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$.
	The error is computed by the following term:
	
	$$ e_{i,j} = x_{i,j} - \pi_i\left(T_i, X_j\right) $$. 
	$i$ is the respective Keyframe and j the index of the map Point. 
	$\pi_i$ is a projection function, calculation a transformation 
	to project all keypoints on mappoints by minimizing a cost function, that
	can be found in \cite{ba}.
	% citat anfang
	\begin{quote}
	In case of full BA
	(used in the map initialization) we optimize
	all points and keyframes, by the exception of the first
	keyframe which remain fixed as the origin. In local BA
	all points included in the local area
	are optimized, while a subset of keyframes is fixed. In
	pose optimization, or motion-only BA, all
	points are fixed and only the camera pose is optimized.
	\end{quote}
	At this point, a local BA is performed.
	
	\item{Local Keyframe Culling}
	
	With difference to other SLAM algorithm, ORB slam delets redundant 
	keyframes, which decreases computational efforts, since computational
	complexity grows with the number of keyframes. All keyframes are deleted, 
	where at least 90 percest of the map points can be found in at least three other 
	keyframes. 
	
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Loop Closing}
	
	The loop closing is computed based on the last inserted keyframe $K_i$. 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Loop Candidates Detection}
	
	First the similarity of $K_i$ to its neighbours in the covisibilty
	graph is computed by using the bag of words representation and a 
	loop candidate $K_l$ might be chosen. 
	
	\item{Similarity Transformation}
	
	In this step the transformation is computet, to map the map points
	from $K_i$ on $K_l$. Since scale can drift, also the scale is computet
	in addition to the rotation matrix and translation using the mothod of horn. 
	
	
	\item{Loop Fusion}
	
	Here, duplicated map points are fused and the keyframe pose $T_\omega$ is corrected by the transformation
	calculated in the previous step. All map points of $K_l$ are projected in $K_i$. 
	All keyframes affected by the fusion will update the edjes (shared map points) in the 
	covisibilty graph. 
	
	\item{ Essential Graph Optimization}
	
	Finally the loop closing error is distributed over the essential graph.

	\section{DSO-SLAM}
	
	Direct Sparse Odometry was developed in 2016 by the Technische Universität München. % hier noch paar sätze dazu
	
	\subsection{Model Overview}\label{samemodel}
	
	The model optimzes the photometric error over a window of recent frames. 
	
	The camera is calibrated in two different ways. First a projection function is computed, considering the focal length and the pricipal point, 
	in order to map a pixel point in the image on a 3D map point (and the other way around). Secondly, a photometric camera calibration is applied. 
	This calibration accounts for camera specific non-linear response functions, that map scene irradiances on pixel intensities on the one hand and 
	camera specific lens attenuations on the other hand. 
	
	The model relies on minimizing the photometric error. This error over all frames is given by
	
	$$E_{\text{photo}}:= \sum_{i \in \mathcal{F}} \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}_i} \sum_{j \in \text{obs}\left(p\right)} E_{pj}$$,
	
	where $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all frames, $\mathcal{P}_i$ the set of all pixel in frame $i$ and $\text{obs}\left(p\right)$
	the set of indices of frames, where the point $p$ occurs. $E_{pj}$ on the other hand is the difference in pixel intensities, calculated 
	by the huber norm, after mapping the pixels on each other and applying an additional affine brightness transfer function. Also, $E_{pj}$ does not 
	include comparing the point $p$, but also computes the pixel intensitie difference of eight pixel neighbors of $p$, arranged in a spread pattern. 
	
	% hier ist noch viel zu schreiben
	
	\subsection{Visual Odometry Front-End}
	
	The front end determine the sets $\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{P}_i$ and $\text{obs}\left(p\right)$. Also it initializes all parameters required to calcualte the term \ref{eq:test}. 
	Finally it decides, when to remove points, outliers and keyframes. Frame and point management are closer described in the following. 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Frame Managemant}
	
	If a new keyframe is created, all map points are mapped into it. In case the root mean squared error of the current frame is more than twice as high than the one before, 
	direct image alignment is assumed to have failed and initialization is tried again. The algorithm tries, to always work with seven active keyframes. All computations are 
	made in reference to those keyframes. 
	
	For creating a new keyframe, 5-10 frames per second are considered for creation. A keyframe must meet all of the following requirements: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{}
	the field of view changes.
	\item{}
	Camera translation causes occlusions. % beschreibung occlusions
	\item{}
	Camera exposure time changes significantly. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	When deciding when to marginalize a keyframe, following roles are applied to the active keyframes $I_1$,...,$I_7$, with $I_1$ beeing the most recent: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{}
	$I_1$ and $I_2$ are always kept
	\item{}
	keyframes, whos amount of points contained in $I_1$ is less then 5 percent are marginalized
	\item{}
	If still too many keyframes are active, the ones having the largest distance to $I_1$, or the worst distribuited in 3D space are removed. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item{Point Managemant}
	
	DSO always tries to keep 2000 active points in the map. The first step is select candidates points of the frame. To obtain equally 
	distributed points, the image is split into blocks. In each block, the point with the largest gradient of pixel intensity is selected, if 
	it is greater than a threshhold, which is computed by adding seven to the overall median of the gradients. This is repeated twice while 
	decreasing the threshhold and doubling the block size, in order to also include points with weaker gradient. 
	% vlt hier noch gradient erklären. 
	
	Then, the point candidates are tracked in subsequent frames by minimizing $E_{pj}$. From the best match, the depth value is initialized. 
	
	When old points are marginalized, candidate points are activated in a way that points in the active map are as evenly distribuited 
	as possible. This is achieved by always selecting the point, which offers the largest distance to the next active point, after projecting
	it into the last active keyframe. 
	
	Since outlier only consume unnecessary ressources, they are tried to be removed. For example, point for which $E_{pj}$ surpasses a threshold 
	are removed permanently. 
	
	\end{enumerate}

	\section{DSM-SLAM}
	
	Direct Sparce Mapping SLAM was released in april 2019 and works similar to DSO slam but claims to be more robust when revisiting 
	areas. The algorithm can be seperated into a tracking 
	front-end and an optimization back-end that run on parallel threads. 
	
	\subsection{Model Overview}
	
		DSM uses the same model as DSO. The model is described in section \ref{samemodel}.
	
	\subsection{Front-End}
	
	The front-end, however, differs from DSO. While DSO cannot reuse points that have one beein marginalized, DSM suggests a method 
	to activate and inactivate keyframes and points to its needs. 
	
	\subsubsection{keyframe and mappoint selection}
	
	When selecting keyframes and mappoints, two criteria play a role: the temporal and covisibility criteria. 
	The temporal parts regards $N_t$ keyframes as recent sliding window approach, just like DSO. With similar 
	critirias for keyframe selection as DSO, whenever a new keyframe is inserted, anotherone is removed (from the temporal part).

	In order to regard reobserved points, DSM also considers $N_c$ covisibil keyframes to fill the latest keyframe $I_0$ with map points, favouring 
	map points in depleted areas. This is achived by the following steps: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Identify depleted areas}
	
	All map points from the temporal part are mapped into the latest keyframe. For every pixel, the eucleadian distance to the closest map point 
	is computed. Obvously, large distances suggest depleted areas.
	
	\item{covisibil Keyframe Selection}
	
	Select the keyframe within the old keyframes with the most map points in the above selected depleted area. Map points, where the viewing angle 
	lies too far from the latest keyframe are removed from the local map. 
	This can be determined from the pose $T_i \in \text{SE}(3)$ that is saved for each keyframe $I_i$. 
	
	\item{Update distance map}
	
	Update the distance map, calculated in step 2, with the new selected keyframe. 
	
	\item{iterate}
	
	Iterate until $N_c$ keyframes are selected for the covisibility part. 
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The entire keyframe and mappoint selection is displayd in figure \ref{fig:dsm_fig}. In this case, $N_t$ is equal to four and $N_c$ is equal to three.
	
	\fig{img/dsmKeyframes.png}{Keyframe and Point Selection of DSM. Source: \cite{dsm}}{fig:dsm_fig}{0.7}
	
	\subsubsection{Frame Tracking, New Keyframe desicion, New Map Point Tracking}
	
	Frame Tracking, New Keyframe desicion and New Map Point Tracking work similar to DSO slam. The main idea is always to manipulate the local map 
	by minimizing the photometric error displayed in equation \ref{eq:test}. 

	However, unlike DSO SLAM, in each frame, the local map 
	consisting of the $N_t + N_c$ keyframes (referenced from the latest keyframe) and contained map points is projected into the frame. 
	Obviously, this also brings the difference compared to DSO slam, that keyframes and map points are not permanently culled from the 
	map, and may be reactivated once the keyframe appears in the covisibilty graph. Also, the management of outliers is similar to DSO-SLAM, 
	Trying to remove outliers as early as possible, in order to save computational resources.
